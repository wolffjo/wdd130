                 Frisk: An orphaned child. She was just relocated to the orphanage where John was living but couldn’t handle the bullying at the orphanage. She chose to go up the mountain where rumor has it, no one returned. John attempted to save her but they both ended up falling down. She is a shy, short child with brown hair that wears a purple sweatshirt with maroon stripes. She currently has limited control over the timeline.

                John: An orphaned child. Frisk was relocated to the orphanage that he was staying at, which is abundant with bullying. He was often the target of this until Frisk came. He attempted to save her at the top of Mount Ebott, but they both ended up falling down. He is also a shy, short child. He has blond hair and wears a white T-shirt. His ability will have to be discovered in the animation.

                Sans:  A skeleton trapped in the underground. He keeps the secrets of his past to himself. He had a brother named Papyrus that aspires to be in the Royal Guard. He and Papyrus are both sentries, constantly on the lookout for humans. He sleeps most of the time, and when he isn’t he is busy coming up with puns or drinking ketchup. His powers can be discovered in Undertale (eventually to be put here).
