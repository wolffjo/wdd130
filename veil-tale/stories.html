                <p>1: He was bored. Again. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as he was in a prison cell, but here he was. Trying to think of some way to pass another uneventful day. So, he thought. A dangerous pastime, but what could he do? The commanding officer would never let him have anything. So, he continued to think. He thought about how he got here. He thought about his newfound abilities. He thought about them. The monsters. Trapped for centuries only to be freed by two children. He would have just killed the lot of them to save the trouble for humanity. </p>
                <p>His thoughts turned back to how he got here. One of the greatest criminals in the world, evading escape for years. Maybe he was getting too old. That can’t be right. He’s barely in his thirties. No. He was still on top of his game. So how? Them. The monsters. Freeing them released tons of magical power into the world. Some people didn’t get that power. He was not one of them. When he found out he had it, he decided to put it to the test with another heist. Turns out the cops had adapted more quickly than he had. </p>
                <p>He grinned, thinking of the fight he gave them. Just because they adapted quicker, didn’t mean he wasn’t more powerful. But eventually, they overpowered him. Numbers or something like that. He was deemed too dangerous with his newfound powers and taken to a secret prison. With only one inmate. Him. </p>
                <p>They had put a magic inhibitor on him. It felt like an arm was cut off. An arm that he hadn’t noticed was there until it was cut off. Only a week and he was that dependent? It didn’t make sense. But nothing did anymore. After all, he was caught. That was supposed to be impossible. Yet here we are.</p>
                <p>He had been in for several months. And it still felt like that arm was missing. The only thing that helped with that loss was the cloud. He looked up very slowly. It was back. It had been following him ever since he discovered his magic. When he was locked up, it kept disappearing. Doing what? He had no idea. But this time, it would stay. He would get it. He needed to. He could feel a shadow of power emanating from it. It might help him.</p>
                <p>The red and black cloud floated closer to him. Nearly there. Almost… Lightning fast, his hand shot out and grabbed it. It started billowing more violently, but he had it. He almost didn’t expect it to work because it was a cloud, but now, he had it. Now what to do with it? He knew he needed to get it, but what now? Then, it spoke.</p>
                <p>“Let me go!!”  It hissed as it twisted and turned. It was hard to keep a grip. </p>
                <p>“What are you?” He asked, voice raspy from lack of speech. He never communed with the guards. "You are always floating around me."</p>
                <p>"I WILL DESTROY YOU IF YOU DO NOT LET ME GO!!", it yelled. He laughed, a truly terrifying sound coming from him. The cloud stopped moving at the sound.</p>
                <p>"If you could, you would have done it already!" He said through his fit. "I, however, could destroy YOU. Unlike you, I don't need magic to do that. You seem pretty tangible for a cloud..." He grinned. Too wide, too toothy. "So tell me. WHAT ARE YOU?"</p>
                <p>"I...am a shell of my former self," it seemed to slump down in his hand, defeated. "You can call me ----------."</p>
                <p>"Very well, ----------," he said, voice heavy with sarcasm. "Why are you following me?" It seemed to perk up</p>
                <p>"You hold power...power I've seen only in one other. Maybe we can help each other?" A sly note started to creep into its voice.</p>
                <p>"How? What do you have to offer me?" Despite his skills, his interest was piqued.</p>
                <p>"You are imprisoned. Magic inhibited. I can help you get free, but I need one thing in exchange," the cloud started billowing again, this time with excitement. </p>
                <p>"I'm listening."</p>
                <p>"I need you to take care of some people for me." That caused him to smile.</p>
                <p>"Take care of some people? You've come to the right person."</p>
                <p>"Do we have a deal?"</p>
                <p>"I do believe we do." ---------- pulsed with red light, and slipped out of his hand into his chest.</p>
