        !Warning! Undertale spoilers ahead! !Warning!
	Undertale: Undertale is a role-playing game by Toby Fox, where you play as a character discovering a secret race of monsters. In this game you can choose different “routes” to take; killing everyone, killing some, or saving them all.
Veil-Tale: Veil-Tale is a to-be animation based on Undertale where the main character of the story discovers this race with another person named John. 
This website will give insight into the characters of both Undertale and Veil-Tale, short stories that deal with the Veil-Tale timeline and show previews of any upcoming animations.

      <h3>Character Bios</h3>
      <p>
        Frisk: An orphaned child. She was just relocated to the orphanage where John was living but couldn’t handle the bullying at the orphanage. She chose to go up the mountain where rumor has it, no one returned. John attempted to save her but they both ended up falling down. She is a shy, short child with brown hair that wears a purple sweatshirt with maroon stripes. She currently has limited control over the timeline. 
	John: An orphaned child. Frisk was relocated to the orphanage that he was staying at, which is abundant with bullying. He was often the target of this until Frisk came. He attempted to save her at the top of Mount Ebott, but they both ended up falling down. He is also a shy, short child. He has blond hair and wears a white T-shirt. His ability will have to be discovered in the animation.
	Sans:  A skeleton trapped in the underground. He keeps the secrets of his past to himself. He had a brother named Papyrus that aspires to be in the Royal Guard. He and Papyrus are both sentries, constantly on the lookout for humans. He sleeps most of the time, and when he isn’t he is busy coming up with puns or drinking ketchup. His powers can be discovered in Undertale (eventually to be put here).

      <h3>Short Stories</h3>
      <p>
        1: He was bored. Again. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as he was in a prison cell, but here he was. Trying to think of some way to pass another uneventful day. So, he thought. A dangerous pastime, but what could he do? The commanding officer would never let him have anything. So, he continued to think. He thought about how he got here. He thought about his newfound abilities. He thought about them. The monsters. Trapped for centuries only to be freed by two children. He would have just killed the lot of them to save the trouble for humanity. 

	His thoughts turned back to how he got here. One of the greatest criminals in the world, evading escape for years. Maybe he was getting too old. That can’t be right. He’s barely in his thirties. No. He was still on top of his game. So how? Them. The monsters. Freeing them released tons of magical power into the world. Some people didn’t get that power. He was not one of them. When he found out he had it, he decided to put it to the test with another heist. Turns out the cops had adapted more quickly than he had. 

	He grinned, thinking of the fight he gave them. Just because they adapted quicker, didn’t mean he wasn’t more powerful. But eventually, they overpowered him. Numbers or something like that. He was deemed too dangerous with his newfound powers and taken to a secret prison. With only one inmate. Him. 

	They had put a magic inhibitor on him. It felt like an arm was cut off. An arm that he hadn’t noticed was there until it was cut off. Only a week and he was that dependent? It didn’t make sense. But nothing did anymore. After all, he was caught. That was supposed to be impossible. Yet here we are.

	He had been in for several months. And it still felt like that arm was missing. The only thing that helped with that loss was the cloud. He looked up very slowly. It was back. It had been following him ever since he discovered his magic. When he was locked up, it kept disappearing. Doing what? He had no idea. But this time, it would stay. He would get it. He needed to. He could feel a shadow of power emanating from it. It might help him.
	The red and black cloud floated closer to him. Nearly there. Almost… Lightning fast, his hand shot out and grabbed it. It started billowing more violently, but he had it. He almost didn’t expect it to work because it was a cloud, but now, he had it. Now what to do with it? He knew he needed to get it, but what now? Then, it spoke.
	“Let me go!!”  It hissed as it twisted and turned. It was hard to keep a grip. 

	“What are you?” He asked, voice raspy from lack of speech. He never communed with the guards.
